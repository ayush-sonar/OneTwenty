# Requirements Document

## Introduction

OneTwenty is a multi-tenant cloud-based SaaS solution that provides a unified interface for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data management across all major CGM brands. The platform addresses the fragmented experience Type 1 diabetics face with proprietary apps, limited sharing capabilities, and irregular features of different CGM brands.

Built from scratch (not a fork), the platform follows the Nightscout API protocol for compatibility while introducing multi-tenant architecture, AI-powered analysis, hardware integrations, and comprehensive sharing features for patients, families, and healthcare providers.
